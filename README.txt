Madotsuki Spritesheet Organization Style:

	Each sprite needs to be 24x32 pixels. If each effect can be separated into 
it's own sheet, that would be awesome. 

See no_effect.png in .resources for an example of how walkcycle sprites should be laid out.

	anything that should show up as transparent needs to have complete alpha 
transparency. I know this seems redundant to say, but a huge portion of the 
sprites in the original game do not use alpha to denote transparency. 

	I'm using github for this project because github makes keeping track
of contriutors extremely easy, so I can credit everyone who helps work on
the project.

	To add spritesheets, click on the "add file" button next to the giant 
green "<>code" button. It will prompt you to make a fork, which will let you edit 
everything in the file. Then when you're done with it, just DM me on discord.
Its super easy to commit with the desktop client, I recommend downloading it 
and learning how to make branches and commits. The program has a built in 
tutorial. My discord is nailbataubrey. Just explain that you're DMing me about 
spritesheets so I know you're not a scammer xD

	I want to thank anyone making sprites for this project so much! If you don't 
want to worry about organizing the spritesheets, just upload your work in the related 
effect's file folder, and I can do it later myself. Just make sure you label each 
animation within the spritesheet itself.
